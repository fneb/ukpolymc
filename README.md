# Instructions for setting up for the UK Poly Discord's modded Minecraft server

Minecraft lets you play around with blocks in a virtual world. Modded Minecraft lets you build machines, play with magic, and more in the same world. Hours and hours of fun.

## Requirements

You will need:

* A Minecraft account. This can be purchased [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/)
* A computer. It doesn't matter if it's a Windows PC or a Mac (or a Linux computer). But you do need something with a little bit of power behind it, most notably a reasonable processor and the more RAM the better. Speak to Fneb or MGrey on Discord if you're in doubt here.

Not required, but helpful:

* Some way of talking to others on Discord via voice, ideally a headset with a microphone (so there's less echo from your surroundings).

## Getting Java set up

First we need to make sure we have Java installed.

### Windows

* Go to the [Java 64-bit download website](https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp) and click on "Agree and Start Free Download".
* Once downloaded, launch the downloaded installer and follow through the instructions.

### Mac

* Go to the [Java Download website](https://java.com/en/download/) and click on Java Download.
* Then click on "Agree and Start Free Download".
* Once downloaded, launch the downloaded installer and follow through the instructions.

## Installing our mod pack

Once Java is installed, we can install our Minecraft mod pack. The mod pack we're going to be using is called "Feed The Beast Infinity Evolved".

* Go to the [Feed the Beast website](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/) and download the launcher for your computer.
* Once downloaded, run the launcher.
* The first time you run the launcher, it will say it wants to set the install directory and language. Click Apply.
