# Instructions for setting up for the UK Poly Discord's modded Minecraft server

Minecraft lets you play around with blocks in a virtual world. Modded Minecraft lets you build machines, play with magic, and more in the same world. Hours and hours of fun.

## Requirements

You will need:

* A Minecraft account. This can be purchased [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/). Please let MGrey on Discord know your username so you can be whitelisted.
* A computer. It doesn't matter if it's a Windows PC or a Mac (or a Linux computer). But you do need something with a little bit of power behind it, most notably a reasonable processor and the more RAM the better. Speak to Fneb or MGrey on Discord if you're in doubt here.

Not required, but helpful:

* Some way of talking to others on Discord via voice, ideally a headset with a microphone (so there's less echo from your surroundings).

## Getting Java set up

First we need to make sure we have Java installed.

### Windows

* Go to the [Java 64-bit download website](https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp) and click on "Agree and Start Free Download".
* Once downloaded, launch the downloaded installer and follow through the instructions.

### Mac

* Go to the [Java Download website](https://java.com/en/download/) and click on Java Download.
* Then click on "Agree and Start Free Download".
* Once downloaded, launch the downloaded installer and follow through the instructions.

## Installing the mod pack

Once Java is installed, we can install our Minecraft mod pack, which will install Minecraft along with it. The mod pack we're going to be using is called "Feed The Beast Infinity Evolved".

* Go to the [Feed the Beast website](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/) and download the launcher for your computer.
* Once downloaded, copy or move the launcher to somewhere you'll be able to access it easily, such as your Desktop or, on a Mac, your Applications folder.
* The first time you run the launcher, it will say it wants to set the install directory and language. Click Apply.
* After a little bit, you'll have two windows. One is "Feed The Beast Launcher Console", which we can ignore (not close). We're interested in the "Feed The Beast Launcher" window.
* In the lower-right, you'll see a drop-down box that says "Select Profile". Click on this, then "Create Profile".
* Enter in your Minecraft account email address and password, then click "Add".
* Click on the "Options" tab along the top.
* We'll want to increase your RAM Maximum, but that will depend on how much RAM your computer has. 
* * To find out how much RAM your Windows computer has, click on the Start menu, type in "System Information", launch it, then look for "Total Physical Memory".
* * If your computer has 4GB of RAM, stick with 2GB of RAM for Minecraft or at a push, 2.5-3GB.
* * If your computer has 8GB of RAM or more, increase Minecraft's RAM to 4GB.
* Back on the "FTB Modpacks" tab, find "FTB Infinity Evolved" in the list. You can search for it using the "Filter Settings" button.
* Select "FTB Infinity Evolved", then on the drop-down that says "Recommended", select "3.1.0".
* Once you have FTB Infinity Evolved selected, and 3.1.0 selected on the version drop-down, click Launch in the lower-right. The first time you do this, it will download Minecraft and the mod pack for you before launching the game.

## Launching Minecraft

Modded Minecraft takes a *long* time to launch. It may crash during the first time you launch it - try launching it again, and if it still struggles then reach out to Fneb or MGrey on Discord for help.

Eventually, you'll get to the main menu. Most of the Options are fine, but you may want to turn the music to 0 and turn down the master volume to a low value if you want to use voice chat with others whilst playing or listen to your own music.

Otherwise, click on the Multiplayer button, then click on "Add server". Enter in the following details:

* Server Name: UK Poly Discord MC
* Server Address: Ask in Discord!

Then click Done. Then, connect!
